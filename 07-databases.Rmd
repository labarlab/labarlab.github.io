## MySQL

A [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/) server is installed on labarserv2 which allows for project data to be stored within a relational database management system ([RDBMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database)). Utilizing a RDBMS allows the researcher to centralize, better manage, and flexibly access their data, and the dedicated structures will help maintain data consistency across users and projects.

### Create an Account

Admins of labarserv2 create accounts and grant access to the mysql server and databases. Start by logging into the server as admin `$sudo mysql`.

Current users and hosts information are available at mysql.user

```
use mysql;
select user, host from user;
```

To [create](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-user.html) a user ('test') identified by a password ('foobar'), specify the new user name, host or IP, and password:

```
create user 'test'@'localhost' identified by 'foobar';
create user 'test'@'127.0.0.1' identified by 'foobar';
```

Next, permissions to a specific database ('db_test'), and also tables if desired, can be [granted](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/grant.html):

```
grant insert, update, select, references
  on db_test.*
  to 'test'@'localhost';
```

Finally, check that appropriate permissions have been added to the user account and then apply the changes to the server:

```
show grants for 'test'@'localhost';
flush privileges;
```

The user should then be able to login to the server via `$mysql -u test -p`, enter their password (foobar), and access the database (`use db_test; show tables;`).
