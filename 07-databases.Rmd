# Databases {#databases}

This chapter is under construction

A [MySQL](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/) server is installed on labarserv2 which allows for project data to be stored within a relational database management system ([RDBMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database)). Utilizing a RDBMS allows the researcher to centralize, better manage, and flexibly access their data, and the dedicated structures will help maintain data consistency across users and projects.

## Create an Account

Admins of labarserv2 create accounts and grant access to the mysql server and databases. Start by logging into the server as admin `$sudo mysql`.

Current users and hosts information are available at mysql.user

```
use mysql;
select user, host from user;
```

To [create a user](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-user.html) ('test') identified by a password ('foobar'), specify the new user name, host or IP, and password:

```
create user 'test'@'localhost' identified by 'foobar';
create user 'test'@'127.0.0.1' identified by 'foobar';
```

Next, permissions to a specific database ('db_test'), and also tables if desired, can be [granted](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/grant.html):

```
grant insert, update, select, references
  on db_test.*
  to 'test'@'localhost';
grant all on db_test.* to 'test'@'localhost'; -- give all permissions
```

Finally, check that appropriate permissions have been added to the user account and then apply the changes to the server:

```
show grants for 'test'@'localhost';
flush privileges;
```

The user should then be able to login to the server via `$mysql -u test -p`, enter their password (foobar), and access the database (`use db_test; show tables;`).


## Login

Users that have an account can login to the mysql server via

`$mysql -u user_name -p`

and then supply their password when prompted. Databases to which the user has access can be listed via `show databases;`. After selecting a database for use (`use db_some_name;`), available tables can be listed via `show tables;`.

A database can also be specified at login:

`$mysql -u user_name -p db_some_name`

Exit the server via `exit;` or `quit;`.


## Create a Database

Admin (i.e. all) privileges are needed by the user to create an database. Accordingly, it is most likely best for labarserv2 admins to create databases and then grant specific (or all) permissions to the user for the specific database.

[Database creation](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/creating-database.html) is accomplished simply via:

`create database db_some_name;`

For the LaBar Lab, the following conventions are implemented:

* Database names start with `db`, e.g. `db_project1` and `db_project2`. This allows for project databases to be identified separately from one another and also distinct from admin and schema databases
* Separate databases are made for separate projects, that is, one project should not span multiple databases
* Database names are succinct, being both descriptive and as short as is reasonable
* Databases are named in snake case (`db_emotion_regulation` and not `db-emotion-regulation`)


## Create a Table

[Tables](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/creating-tables.html) are 2-dimensional matrices containing rows and columns of data. Each row must contain unique information, and each column contains only one [data type](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/data-types.html). Whether to use long- or wide-formatted tables depends on the user and nature of the data, but long-formatted tables (or at least [tidy](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tidyr/vignettes/tidy-data.html)) is preferable.

The `create table` syntax is used within a database to both create the table and specify the number and types of columns. Three types of tables (reference, data, and definition) are used in the LaBar Lab, which are prepended with `ref_`, `tbl_`, and `def_` identifiers, respectively.


### Reference Tables

When a certain value, such as a participant ID or emotion name, show up across multiple data tables, the value can be stored in a reference table rather than be used repeatedly across multiple tables. These reference tables, and the fact that values from multiple databases can be queried at once, are the point of RDBMSs. As an added perk, the size of the database is also decreased as redundant values are minimized.

Say a project intends to gather information across multiple subjects, each of whom will participate in three sessions, and some measures will occur during all sessions. We can then set up reference tables for the subject IDs, session IDs, and emotion IDs.

To start a reference table for subject IDs, then:

```
use db_test;
create table ref_subj (
  subj_id int not null,
  subj_name char(4) not null,
  primary key(subj_id)
);
```
Here we create a table titled 'ref_subj' in the database 'db_test'. This table contains two columns: the first column is titled 'subj_id', is integer type, and does not allow null values. The second column is titled 'subj_name', the value uses exactly 4 characters, and also null values are not allowed. Finally, the [primary key](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-basics/mysql-primary-key/) is set to reference the 'subj_id' column. This key is used to uniquely identify each row in the table, and will serve as the reference value across database tables.

A description of the table is available via the `describe table_name` command:

```
mysql> describe ref_subj;
+-----------+---------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| Field     | Type    | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
+-----------+---------+------+-----+---------+-------+
| subj_id   | int     | NO   | PRI | NULL    |       |
| subj_name | char(4) | NO   |     | NULL    |       |
+-----------+---------+------+-----+---------+-------+
2 rows in set (0.01 sec)
```

The LaBar Lab uses the following conventions with respect to reference tables:

* The table name starts with 'ref_'
* The name for columns involved in the primary key ends in '_id'
* The value which corresponds to the primary key ends in '_name'
* The table name is reflected in column names when possible (e.g. 'subj')

Following these conventions will increase the ease of joining tables and allow other researchers to more readily understand the data structure.

Data can then be added to the table via `insert` by specifying the desired columns and input values:

```
insert into ref_subj
  (subj_id, subj_name)
  values
  (1, "SUB1"),
  (2, "SUB2"),
  (3, "SUB3"),
  (4, "SUB4");
```

Check that the reference table is properly specified via `select`:

```
mysql> select * from ref_subj;
+---------+-----------+
| subj_id | subj_name |
+---------+-----------+
|       1 | SUB1      |
|       2 | SUB2      |
|       3 | SUB3      |
|       4 | SUB4      |
+---------+-----------+
4 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

The other reference tables, for session and emotion, can likewise be built (note the variable emotion name length):

```
-- Session reference
create table ref_sess (
    sess_id int not null,
    sess_name char(4) not null,
    primary key(sess_id)
);
insert into ref_sess
    (sess_id, sess_name)
    values
    (1, "day1"),
    (2, "day2"),
    (3, "day3");

-- Emotion reference
create table ref_emo (
    emo_id int not null,
    emo_name varchar(10) not null,
    primary key(emo_id)
);
insert into ref_emo
    (emo_id, emo_name)
    values
    (1, "amusement"),
    (2, "anger"),
    (3, "anxiety"),
    (4, "awe"),
    (5, "calmness"),
    (6, "craving"),
    (7, "disgust"),
    (8, "excitement"),
    (9, "fear"),
    (10, "horror"),
    (11, "joy"),
    (12, "neutral"),
    (13, "romance"),
    (14, "sadness"),
    (15, "surprise");
```


### Data Tables

Data from each measure collected is stored in data tables, with repeated values linked to reference tables. Building data tables uses the same methodology described above, with the addition of specifying [foreign keys](https://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/what-is-a-foreign-key/) and thus begin to make our database relational.

Let us suppose that for each session our participants supply PANAS and ERQ ratings as well as an in-house measure (EmoFreq) where participants are prompted to respond how frequently, intensely, and saliently they felt a given emotion (`ref_emo`) over the previous week.

Using the `create table` syntax, again, we first build a data table for the PANAS questionnaire:

```
create table tbl_panas (
    subj_id int not null,
    sess_id int not null,
    item_panas int not null,
    resp_panas int,
    primary key(subj_id, sess_id, item_panas),
    foreign key(subj_id) references ref_subj(subj_id) on delete cascade,
    foreign key(sess_id) references ref_sess(sess_id)
);
```

Here we created a long-formatted table containing four columns -- one for the subject identifier ('subj_id'), session identifier ('sess_id'), PANAS item/prompt ('item_panas'), and participant reponse to PANAS item/prompt ('resp_panas'). Participant responses are recorded as integer type, and only the PANAS item number (integer) is used -- if it was desired to keep the question syntax rather than item number then a reference table could be set up ('ref_panas') and this column would be named 'panas_id', following LaBar Lab conventions. Also note that 'item_panas' is specified as 'not null' as participants will see every PANAS item, but as participants may not respond to each item and accordingly 'resp_panas' allows for null values. 

The primary key is specified here as a composition of subject, session, and PANAS item (sometimes termed a 'composite key' or 'natural key'). This serves as as the unique identifier for each participant response. It is recommended to always explicitly specify your primary key as failure to do so will result in mysql silently generating a primary key. Additionally, explicitly controlling keys helps in setting up proper [relationship mappings](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/sqlserver/tables-relations). If a natural key ought not to be used for a primary key, or data naturally increment, then a column could be set to [auto increment](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/example-auto-increment.html) and serve as the primary key.

Foreign keys are used to reflect that the value of the column is linked to (relational with) another table. Here, the columns 'subj_id' and 'sess_id' will not be populated with the actual subject and session IDs, as that would involve a lot of repetitive information, but instead their respective database ID. Specifically, we set the 'subj_id' column (`tbl_panas.subj_id`) to reference the 'subj_id' column of 'ref_subj' (`ref_subj.subj_id`). Similarly `tbl_panas.sess_id` references `ref_sess.sess_id`. Finally, [`on delete cascade`](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-basics/mysql-on-delete-cascade/) allows records from this current table to be removed if the referenced value in `ref_subj` is deleted (perhaps due to participant withdrawal).

The LaBar Lab uses a number of conventions in creating data tables:

* The table name starts with 'tbl_'
* The measure name is reflected in the table name and relevant columns when possible
* The name for columns that become a foreign key end in '_id' when possible
* Column names for measure identifiers start with 'item_'
* Participant responses start with 'resp_'

Likewise, data tables for the ERQ and in-house EmoFreq surveys can be made:

```
-- ERQ table
create table tbl_erq (
    subj_id int not null,
    sess_id int not null,
    item_erq int not null,
    resp_erq int,
    primary key(subj_id, item_erq),
    foreign key(subj_id) references ref_subj(subj_id) on delete cascade,
    foreign key(sess_id) references ref_sess(sess_id)
);

-- EmoFreq table
create table tbl_emofreq (
    subj_id int not null,
    sess_id int not null,
    emo_id int not null,
    resp_frq int,
    resp_int int,
    resp_sal int,
    primary key(subj_id, sess_id, emo_id),
    foreign key(subj_id) references ref_subj(subj_id) on delete cascade,
    foreign key(sess_id) references ref_sess(sess_id),
    foreign key(emo_id) references ref_emo(emo_id)
);
```

For the in-house EmoFreq survey, where participants are prompted with an emotion and they respond how frequently, intensely, and saliently they experienced the emotion over the previous week, the 'item_' column was omitted and replaced with the foreign key `emo_id`. Additionally, better names for the response columns could have been `resp_emofreq_frequency` etc., particularly if other measures elicit similar responses. This was omitted to illustrate the utility of definition tables.

Finally, following foreign keys to their source is available in the `information_schema` database:

```
SELECT
  `TABLE_SCHEMA`,
  `TABLE_NAME`,
  `COLUMN_NAME`,
  `REFERENCED_TABLE_SCHEMA`,
  `REFERENCED_TABLE_NAME`,
  `REFERENCED_COLUMN_NAME`
FROM
  `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`.`KEY_COLUMN_USAGE`
WHERE
  `TABLE_SCHEMA` = SCHEMA()
  AND `REFERENCED_TABLE_NAME` IS NOT NULL;
```

which yields:

```
+--------------+-------------+-------------+-------------------------+-----------------------+------------------------+
| TABLE_SCHEMA | TABLE_NAME  | COLUMN_NAME | REFERENCED_TABLE_SCHEMA | REFERENCED_TABLE_NAME | REFERENCED_COLUMN_NAME |
+--------------+-------------+-------------+-------------------------+-----------------------+------------------------+
| db_test      | tbl_emofreq | subj_id     | db_test                 | ref_subj              | subj_id                |
| db_test      | tbl_emofreq | sess_id     | db_test                 | ref_sess              | sess_id                |
| db_test      | tbl_emofreq | emo_id      | db_test                 | ref_emo               | emo_id                 |
| db_test      | tbl_erq     | subj_id     | db_test                 | ref_subj              | subj_id                |
| db_test      | tbl_erq     | sess_id     | db_test                 | ref_sess              | sess_id                |
| db_test      | tbl_panas   | subj_id     | db_test                 | ref_subj              | subj_id                |
| db_test      | tbl_panas   | sess_id     | db_test                 | ref_sess              | sess_id                |
+--------------+-------------+-------------+-------------------------+-----------------------+------------------------+
7 rows in set (0.00 sec)
```

This is useful when tracking the relationship mappings (such as when working with a new database or when table/column names are less-than-helpful), and requires the `references` grant for the user.
