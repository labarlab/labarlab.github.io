Welcome! 

This repository serves as the codebase for the [LaBarLab Manual](https://labarlab.github.io).

Chapters are written in R Markdown and [bookdown](https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown) is used to build the book.

Additional resources:

- YouTube [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RdSmYvbQkhs) for building with bookdown and serving with GitHub Pages.
- The bookdown package reference [site]( https://pkgs.rstudio.com/bookdown).
- A nice [example](https://github.com/EcoRepSci/reproducible-science) of another bookdown GitHub Page.
