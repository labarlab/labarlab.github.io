Ported to bookdown by Nathan Muncy on Jul 26, 2022. 1.1 Location The CCN is located in the Levine Science Research Center on Research Dr. in Duke’s West campus. It is named after Leon Levine, a NC native that is the founder of the Family Dollar retail stores. The building is a multidisciplinary research center, including computer sciences, environmental sciences, and pharmacology. The building has 4 sections, designated A, B, C, and D wings. Individual rooms are named with the wing prefix followed by 3 digits, the first indicates the floor. For example, the Kevin’s office is located in B247 (B wing and 2nd floor). Doors into the building are unlocked during normal weekday business hours, however they lock in the evening, during weekends, and during holidays. You can enter the building when the doors are locked by using your Duke ID in the external door card swipe on either side of the B wing lobby. The lab is located in B104. The lab is accessed by a door in the main lobby of the building. This door is accessible via Duke ID card swipe or a lab key. There are three testing rooms in the lab. The first is the Main testing room, which includes the Biopac MP160 psychophysiology testing system. The second is Room 2 Behavioral 2 (R2B2), which is the small testing room that can only collect behavioral data. The final testing room, 3rd - Psychophysiology Office (3PO), will contain an MP150 psychophysiology testing setup when the room gets completed. 1.2 Duke Card All students and employees must have a DukeCard, the official ID card for the university. There are 2 types of ID cards, a standard card (Magnetic stripe) and one with an embedded HID chip (Proximity card). All lab members should have cards with a HID chip, security doors at the hospital use these chips to determine security clearance. If you do not have a card or need a replacement, the office is located in the rear of the Telcom Building and there is an exterior door that leads into the office. The office is open M-F from 8am – 6pm. A government issued ID card (e.g., driver’s license, passport, etc.) is required to obtain a DukeCard. The lab will pay for the first card via an IR form, which has to be approved by the department HR representative. Replacement cards (lost/stolen) cost $15. You can also use your DukeCard as a pre-paid debit card through the Flexible Spending Account (FLEX). The FLEX account is automatically created when the DukeCard is issued. There is no minimum deposit to open an account. You can deposit funds into your account online. Employees can also set up an automatic deduction from your pay by going to the Duke@Work My Pay tab. The funds can be used at most places on campus, but you cannot use the account to withdraw cash. If you are a non-Duke student or visiting scholar, the process is similar to the above, but you will also have to get a sponsored Duke account from the LaBar lab manager before beginning the process. 1.3 Computer Access Keoki is the name of our data storage server. The primary folder we use in the lab is experiments2, which contains data from recently completed experiments, current experiments, lab member folders, administrative documents, and website attributes. To get on the whitelist to access Keoki, please see the LaBar lab manager. Once whitelisted, the path to map keoki/experiments2 to your computer is :\\\\ccn-keoki.win.duke.edu\\experiments2 for PC or smb://ccn-keoki.wim.duke.edu/experiments2 for Mac. 1.4 Human Research Training Information outlined below pertains to trainings that must be completed by all key personal part of a DUHS IRB protocol (for a research study are research personnel who are directly involved in conducting the research with human subjects through an interaction or intervention for research purposes, including participating in the consent process by either leading it or contributing to it; OR who are directly involved with recording or processing identifiable private information, including protected health information, related to those subjects for the purpose of conducting the research study): Collaborative Training Initiative (CITI) modules for graduate students and staff: Navigate to www.citiprogram.org Log in via SSO with your Duke NetID and password Choose “Duke Health” Complete required modules: Biomedical Research – Basic/Refresher New individuals are required to take nine modules (automatically populates once appropriate registration is complete). Individuals who have already completed the training will be required to renew their credentials every three years with refresher modules. CITI will send you an automated email 90 days prior to expiration. Undergraduates: Navigate to www.citiprogram.org Log in via SSO with your Duke NetID and password Choose “Duke University Campus IRB” Complete required modules: History and Ethical Principles If an undergraduate is going to be working on a Medical school IRB, they will have to complete the CITI training for grad students/ staff. In addition to CITI, undergraduates who will be involved in the consenting process must also complete Informed Consent Process training specifically for undergraduates. Please note that other conditions and restrictions apply, depending on which department the IRB is housed under; for more information please see the Undergraduates Engaged in Consent Policy.

Ported to bookdown by Nathan Muncy on Jul 26, 2022. 2.1 LaBar Lab Shared Drive (keoki) Request LaBar lab whitelist permissions from the lab manager (can sometimes take 24 hours for the update to push through). Map the network drive For Windows, go to My computer or This PC and map network drive. Choose a drive and enter \\\\ccn-keoki.win.duke.edu\\experiments2\\ to access the lab’s shared drive. Keep in mind that this is mapped to the specific PC you are using, so will need to remap it to other computers as needed. For Mac OSx, open Finder and select go. Select connect to server and enter smb://ccn-keoki.win.duke.edu/experiments2/ to access the lab’s shared drive. Keep in mind that this is mapped to the specific PC you are using, so will need to remap it to other computers as needed. 2.2 BIAC Servers This document contains information on installing and setting up the local software necessary to log into and transfer files to/from the BIAC servers. This is required in order to access any imaging data collected at BIAC. Remotely logging into the BIAC servers will also allow you to run scripts on the servers and use the various image analysis software packages installed there. NOTE 1: BIAC recently (11/2015) began requiring Duke’s multi-factor authentication system in order to log into their servers. If you have not set this up already, see this web page for details. NOTE 2: You will need a DHE account to fully log into the BIAC servers. 2.2.1 Mac OSx Users Mac OSX comes with the software necessary to log into and transfer files from the BIAC servers; no additional installation is required. 2.2.1.1 Logging into the BIAC Servers Open a Terminal window. The Terminal application can be found in …/Applications/Utilities. Type ssh -o ServerAliveInterval=120 -o TCPKeepAlive=no -X &lt;username&gt;@hugin.biac.duke.edu (replacing “username” with your actual user name) into the Terminal window. After typing in your password when prompted and completing multi-factor authentication you will be logged into the BIAC servers. If you are presented with an “are you sure you want to connect” question, just type “yes”. 2.2.1.2 Copying Files from the BIAC Servers Open a Terminal window. The Terminal application can be found in …/Applications/Utilities. Use the scp command to copy files between the BIAC servers and your local computer. 2.2.1.3 Examples Copy from BIAC to local: scp &lt;username&gt;@hugin.biac.duke.edu:/path/to/file /localpath/ Copy from local to BIAC: scp &lt;-r&gt; /localpath/ &lt;username&gt;@hugin.biac.duke.edu:/path/to/file In the examples above, replace “username” with your user name, “path” with the full path to the desired directory on the BIAC server, “file” with the name of the file (including 3-character file extension), and “localpath” with the full path to the desired local directory. Note that the scp command has options for copying multiple files at once, for more info on scp, see here. 2.2.2 Windows Users Two additional programs will need to be installed, one that handles logging into the BIAC servers and another that handles file transfer. 2.2.2.1 Logging into the BIAC Servers Download and install X-Win32. This can be done via Duke’s OIT site (Browse and Order Software). Set up X-Win32 to get to the BIAC servers. Follow the instructions here. Once X-Win is set up, select the hugin connection (or whatever you named it) and click “Launch”. Enter your password/multi-factor authenticate when prompted and you should end up with a BIAC server terminal window. If you receive an “are you sure you want to connect” question, just type “yes.” 2.2.2.2 Copying Files from the BIAC Servers Download and install WinSCP. This can be done from Duke’s OIT site (Browse and Order Software). Set up WinSCP to get to the BIAC servers. Create a new “Site” in WinSCP (this can be called whatever you want, but “BIAC” is a good suggestion) with the following values: File Protocol: SFTP Host name: nernst.biac.duke.edu Port number: 22 User Name: (your user name) Once the new site is created, highlight it and click “Login”. After password/authentication prompts this should provide a graphical interface for transferring files, very similar in appearance and function to Windows Explorer. 2.2.3 After Succesful Login The BIAC servers run linux. You’ll need to type linux commands at the command prompt in order to do anything. An introduction to this environment can be found here. The BIAC servers also have a variety of image analysis software packages installed. In order to use any of them, you’ll need to enter “interactive” mode by simply typing “qinteract” into the command line. This may prompt another password/authentication request. The list of installed software can be found here.

These electrodes detect the small electrical changes that are a consequence of cardiac muscle depolarization followed by repolarization during each cardiac cycle (heartbeat)\\(^1\\). Our lab uses a 3 lead setup, where electrodes will be placed at 3 points on the body. Specifically, we follow a lead II configuration (see the diagram below). The lead II configuration consists of having the negative lead attached to the right wrist, the positive lead attached to the left ankle, and a grounded lead attached to the right ankle. We prefer to use this configuration as the electrode placements interfere the least with other psychophysiology measure electrode placements. You can run using other configurations, but keep in mind the possible interference from other electrodes. 3.2 Supplies 3 x EL203 disposable electrodes LEAD110 LEAD110S-R (the shielded red lead) LEAD110S-W (the shielded white lead) Paper towel Nuprep 3 x Q-Tips Cotton wipe/ cotton round/ tissue Gel 100 3.3 Computer Preparation Log into psychophysiology computer. Turn on BIOPAC system. Open Acknowledge (5.0 for MP160 system, 4.1 for MP150 system). Load experimental file template. Check that the input is Channel 4 (analog). Check where the data is being saved. 3.4 Lead Preparation Take the red lead and attach it to the ECG cable in the testing room by attaching the red insert into the Vin\\(+\\) slot and the black insert into the top shield slot. Repeat with the white lead by attaching the white insert into the Vin\\(-\\) slot and the black insert into the bottom shield slot. Insert the black lead with the CBL205 attachment into the GND slot on the ECG cable. 3.5 Electrode Preparation and Placement Have the subject wash their hands/wrists with non-moisturizing and dye-free soap then dry with a paper towel (if there is no soap following the specifications, have the participant rinse with just water). Prepare the q-tips with a drop of Nuprep each. Instruct the participant to scrub an area of the lower right wrist/ upper right forearm (see below) with a prepped q-tip (make sure the location is slightly offset to the left of the arm mid-line). Repeat step 3 with the remaining q-tips for the areas behind the participant’s ankles (see below, which is not directly on the ankle, but behind the ankle before the Achilles tendon slightly below the ankle mid-line). Have the participant clean off the Nuprep with a water wet cotton round or tissue. Have participant dry applied areas with another cotton round or tissue. While subject is drying, apply a “pea sized” drop of Gel 100 to the underside of one of the disposable electrodes. Apply the gelled electrode to one of the three sites. Repeat steps 7 and 8 for the two remaining sites. 3.6 Lead Application and Clean Up Unlike other psychophysiology measures in the lab, it is absolutely critical to attach and remove the leads to the participant in the correct order! Take black ground lead and attach it to the subject’s right ankle electrode. Take the white lead and attach it to the subject’s right arm electrode. Take the red lead and attach it to the subject’s left ankle electrode. Run the experiment. When finished, remove the leads in the inverse order you applied them (Red lead, white lead, black lead). Have the subjects peel off the electrodes and dispose of them in the trash. Offer the subject a wet paper towel or alcohol wipe to clean up any excess electrode gel that may be on them. Hang all three leads back onto the ECG hook in the testing room. 3.7 References Electrocardiography. (2022, Jul 27).

Historically, EDA has been known as galvanic skin response or GSR (the MP150 has a module that is still labelled as GSR. It is believed that skin resistance varies with the state of sweat glands in the skin. Sweating is controlled by the sympathetic nervous system, and skin conductance is an indication of psychological or physiological arousal. If the sympathetic branch of the autonomic nervous system is highly aroused, then sweat gland activity also increases, which in turn increases skin conductance. In this way, skin conductance can be a measure of emotional and sympathetic responses\\(^1\\). Our lab in particular looks at EDA in the palm of the hand, as it allows for subjects to use their fingers to enter computer responses to stimuli, without affecting the data. 4.2 Procedures The following outlines the standard procedure for collecting skin conductance data in our lab. Note: Place the electrodes a minimum of 5 minutes before recording, but aim for closer to 15 minutes. Have the subject gently wash their hands with soap and water. Use the specific soap provided by the lab for this purpose, whether in the lab or the BIAC. Moisturizers and anti-bacterial components of soap products can affect conductivity in the skin; these can be difficult to avoid for our purposes, but we can be consistent about our use. More importantly, the soap should not be abrasive (micro-scrubbing beads and such) as this damage to the skin tissue can change its composition and conductivity. Dry hands gently but completely before electrode placement. Use the disposable electrodes that come with gel already applied. Add a pea-sized drop of electrode gel on top of the gel in the electrode. We add fresh gel because the original gel dries over time and may not mix as well with the skin. Place the electrode firmly on the hypothenar eminence of the non-dominant palm at a perpendicular orientation to the eminence leaving space for two adjacent electrodes along the length of the eminence. Apply the second electrode. Apply tape if necessary to keep electrodes in place (for example, if the subject has excessively sweaty hands). While the distal phalanges may be a slightly more ideal site for recording in terms of eccrine sweat gland distribution, the size of the hypothenar eminence allows for easier and more secure electrode placement and allows for more use of the fingers on the recording hand. The subject may make responses with the fingers of the non-dominant hand as long as these responses do not occur during periods that will be analyzed for skin conductance. Further, the subject should be instructed to minimize any unnecessary movement of the recording hand since movement can introduce noise into the signal. Connect the wires to electrodes so they are not obstructive or uncomfortable. Begin acquisition with AcqKnowledge and check for proper signal. You can ask the subject to hold their breath briefly and then exhale to try to prompt a skin conductance response. If it seems likely the subject’s conductance will hit ceiling levels at some point, the gain switch on the front of the GSR BIOPAC module may be repositioned from 10 microsiemens/volt to 20 before beginning the task and the data rescaled in AcqKnowledge accordingly. This should rarely be necessary, but be sure to note this in the subject’s notes and replace the switch after the subject’s session is complete. AcqKnowledge note: We have been recording skin conductance at a frequency of 1 kHz in AcqKnowledge. 4.3 References Electrodermal activity. (2022, Jul 28).
