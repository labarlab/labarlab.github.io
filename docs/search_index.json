This digital book contains resources and learning materials compiled for the LaBaratory of emotion and cognition. Content is organized in the following chapters: Chapter 1, Getting Started Chapter 2, Accessing Servers "],["getting-started.html", "Chapter 1 Getting Started 1.1 Location 1.2 Duke Card 1.3 Computer Access 1.4 Human Research Training", " Chapter 1 Getting Started Text written by Gregory Steward on Jun 05, 2019. Ported to bookdown by Nathan Muncy on Jul 26, 2022. 1.1 Location The CCN is located in the Levine Science Research Center on Research Dr. in Duke’s West campus. It is named after Leon Levine, a NC native that is the founder of the Family Dollar retail stores. The building is a multidisciplinary research center, including computer sciences, environmental sciences, and pharmacology. The building has 4 sections, designated A, B, C, and D wings. Individual rooms are named with the wing prefix followed by 3 digits, the first indicates the floor. For example, the Kevin’s office is located in B247 (B wing and 2nd floor). Doors into the building are unlocked during normal weekday business hours, however they lock in the evening, during weekends, and during holidays. You can enter the building when the doors are locked by using your Duke ID in the external door card swipe on either side of the B wing lobby. The lab is located in B104. The lab is accessed by a door in the main lobby of the building. This door is accessible via Duke ID card swipe or a lab key. There are three testing rooms in the lab. The first is the Main testing room, which includes the Biopac MP160 psychophysiology testing system. The second is Room 2 Behavioral 2 (R2B2), which is the small testing room that can only collect behavioral data. The final testing room, 3rd - Psychophysiology Office (3PO), will contain an MP150 psychophysiology testing setup when the room gets completed. 1.2 Duke Card All students and employees must have a DukeCard, the official ID card for the university. There are 2 types of ID cards, a standard card (Magnetic stripe) and one with an embedded HID chip (Proximity card). All lab members should have cards with a HID chip, security doors at the hospital use these chips to determine security clearance. If you do not have a card or need a replacement, the office is located in the rear of the Telcom Building and there is an exterior door that leads into the office. The office is open M-F from 8am – 6pm. A government issued ID card (e.g., driver’s license, passport, etc.) is required to obtain a DukeCard. The lab will pay for the first card via an IR form, which has to be approved by the department HR representative. Replacement cards (lost/stolen) cost $15. You can also use your DukeCard as a pre-paid debit card through the Flexible Spending Account (FLEX). The FLEX account is automatically created when the DukeCard is issued. There is no minimum deposit to open an account. You can deposit funds into your account online. Employees can also set up an automatic deduction from your pay by going to the Duke@Work My Pay tab. The funds can be used at most places on campus, but you cannot use the account to withdraw cash. If you are a non-Duke student or visiting scholar, the process is similar to the above, but you will also have to get a sponsored Duke account from the LaBar lab manager before beginning the process. 1.3 Computer Access Keoki is the name of our data storage server. The primary folder we use in the lab is experiments2, which contains data from recently completed experiments, current experiments, lab member folders, administrative documents, and website attributes. To get on the whitelist to access Keoki, please see the LaBar lab manager. Once whitelisted, the path to map keoki/experiments2 to your computer is :\\\\ccn-keoki.win.duke.edu\\experiments2 for PC or smb://ccn-keoki.wim.duke.edu/experiments2 for Mac. 1.4 Human Research Training Information outlined below pertains to trainings that must be completed by all key personal part of a DUHS IRB protocol (for a research study are research personnel who are directly involved in conducting the research with human subjects through an interaction or intervention for research purposes, including participating in the consent process by either leading it or contributing to it; OR who are directly involved with recording or processing identifiable private information, including protected health information, related to those subjects for the purpose of conducting the research study): Collaborative Training Initiative (CITI) modules for graduate students and staff: Navigate to www.citiprogram.org Log in via SSO with your Duke NetID and password Choose “Duke Health” Complete required modules: Biomedical Research – Basic/Refresher New individuals are required to take nine modules (automatically populates once appropriate registration is complete). Individuals who have already completed the training will be required to renew their credentials every three years with refresher modules. CITI will send you an automated email 90 days prior to expiration. Undergraduates: Navigate to www.citiprogram.org Log in via SSO with your Duke NetID and password Choose “Duke University Campus IRB” Complete required modules: History and Ethical Principles If an undergraduate is going to be working on a Medical school IRB, they will have to complete the CITI training for grad students/ staff. In addition to CITI, undergraduates who will be involved in the consenting process must also complete Informed Consent Process training specifically for undergraduates. Please note that other conditions and restrictions apply, depending on which department the IRB is housed under; for more information please see the Undergraduates Engaged in Consent Policy.

Ported to bookdown by Nathan Muncy on Jul 26, 2022. 2.1 LaBar Lab Shared Drive (keoki) Request LaBar lab whitelist permissions from the lab manager (can sometimes take 24 hours for the update to push through). Map the network drive For Windows, go to My computer or This PC and map network drive. Choose a drive and enter \\\\ccn-keoki.win.duke.edu\\experiments2\\ to access the lab’s shared drive. Keep in mind that this is mapped to the specific PC you are using, so will need to remap it to other computers as needed. For Mac OSx, open Finder and select go. Select connect to server and enter smb://ccn-keoki.win.duke.edu/experiments2/ to access the lab’s shared drive. Keep in mind that this is mapped to the specific PC you are using, so will need to remap it to other computers as needed. 2.2 BIAC Servers This document contains information on installing and setting up the local software necessary to log into and transfer files to/from the BIAC servers. This is required in order to access any imaging data collected at BIAC. Remotely logging into the BIAC servers will also allow you to run scripts on the servers and use the various image analysis software packages installed there. NOTE 1: BIAC recently (11/2015) began requiring Duke’s multi-factor authentication system in order to log into their servers. If you have not set this up already, see this web page for details. NOTE 2: You will need a DHE account to fully log into the BIAC servers. 2.2.1 Mac OSx Users Mac OSX comes with the software necessary to log into and transfer files from the BIAC servers; no additional installation is required. 2.2.1.1 Logging into the BIAC Servers Open a Terminal window. The Terminal application can be found in …/Applications/Utilities. Type ssh -o ServerAliveInterval=120 -o TCPKeepAlive=no -X &lt;username&gt;@hugin.biac.duke.edu (replacing “username” with your actual user name) into the Terminal window. After typing in your password when prompted and completing multi-factor authentication you will be logged into the BIAC servers. If you are presented with an “are you sure you want to connect” question, just type “yes”. 2.2.1.2 Copying Files from the BIAC Servers Open a Terminal window. The Terminal application can be found in …/Applications/Utilities. Use the scp command to copy files between the BIAC servers and your local computer. 2.2.1.3 Examples Copy from BIAC to local: scp &lt;username&gt;@hugin.biac.duke.edu:/path/to/file /localpath/ Copy from local to BIAC: scp &lt;-r&gt; /localpath/ &lt;username&gt;@hugin.biac.duke.edu:/path/to/file In the examples above, replace “username” with your user name, “path” with the full path to the desired directory on the BIAC server, “file” with the name of the file (including 3-character file extension), and “localpath” with the full path to the desired local directory. Note that the scp command has options for copying multiple files at once, for more info on scp, see here. 2.2.2 Windows Users Two additional programs will need to be installed, one that handles logging into the BIAC servers and another that handles file transfer. 2.2.2.1 Logging into the BIAC Servers Download and install X-Win32. This can be done via Duke’s OIT site (Browse and Order Software). Set up X-Win32 to get to the BIAC servers. Follow the instructions here. Once X-Win is set up, select the hugin connection (or whatever you named it) and click “Launch”. Enter your password/multi-factor authenticate when prompted and you should end up with a BIAC server terminal window. If you receive an “are you sure you want to connect” question, just type “yes.” 2.2.2.2 Copying Files from the BIAC Servers Download and install WinSCP. This can be done from Duke’s OIT site (Browse and Order Software). Set up WinSCP to get to the BIAC servers. Create a new “Site” in WinSCP (this can be called whatever you want, but “BIAC” is a good suggestion) with the following values: File Protocol: SFTP Host name: nernst.biac.duke.edu Port number: 22 User Name: (your user name) Once the new site is created, highlight it and click “Login”. After password/authentication prompts this should provide a graphical interface for transferring files, very similar in appearance and function to Windows Explorer. 2.2.3 After Succesful Login The BIAC servers run linux. You’ll need to type linux commands at the command prompt in order to do anything. An introduction to this environment can be found here. The BIAC servers also have a variety of image analysis software packages installed. In order to use any of them, you’ll need to enter “interactive” mode by simply typing “qinteract” into the command line. This may prompt another password/authentication request. The list of installed software can be found here. "],["parts.html", "Chapter 3 Parts", " Chapter 3 Parts You can add parts to organize one or more book chapters together. Parts can be inserted at the top of an .Rmd file, before the first-level chapter heading in that same file. Add a numbered part: # (PART) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an unnumbered part: # (PART\\*) Act one {-} (followed by # A chapter) Add an appendix as a special kind of un-numbered part: # (APPENDIX) Other stuff {-} (followed by # A chapter). Chapters in an appendix are prepended with letters instead of numbers.

Like this one 1. 4.2 Citations Reference items in your bibliography file(s) using @key. For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2022) (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (Xie 2015) (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib). Note that the .bib files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML bibliography key. The RStudio Visual Markdown Editor can also make it easier to insert citations: https://rstudio.github.io/visual-markdown-editing/#/citations References "],["blocks.html", "Chapter 5 Blocks 5.1 Equations 5.2 Theorems and proofs 5.3 Callout blocks", " Chapter 5 Blocks 5.1 Equations Here is an equation. \\[\\begin{equation} f\\left(k\\right) = \\binom{n}{k} p^k\\left(1-p\\right)^{n-k} \\tag{5.1} \\end{equation}\\] You may refer to using \\@ref(eq:binom), like see Equation (5.1). 5.2 Theorems and proofs Labeled theorems can be referenced in text using \\@ref(thm:tri), for example, check out this smart theorem 5.1. Theorem 5.1 For a right triangle, if \\(c\\) denotes the length of the hypotenuse and \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) denote the lengths of the other two sides, we have \\[a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\] Read more here https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/markdown-extensions-by-bookdown.html. 5.3 Callout blocks The R Markdown Cookbook provides more help on how to use custom blocks to design your own callouts: https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/custom-blocks.html "],["sharing-your-book.html", "Chapter 6 Sharing your book 6.1 Publishing 6.2 404 pages 6.3 Metadata for sharing", " Chapter 6 Sharing your book 6.1 Publishing HTML books can be published online, see: https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/publishing.html 6.2 404 pages By default, users will be directed to a 404 page if they try to access a webpage that cannot be found. If you’d like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 6.3 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your book’s title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your book’s source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapter’s source file.
